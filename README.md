# flip-lichess-knights

Flip the orientation of knights on [lichess.org](https://lichess.org).

Credit to [@Fins](https://en.lichess.org/@/Fins) for the idea.

To install, download the latest release and follow instructions for installing a Chrome extension from a zip file (like [these](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-install-chrome-extensions-manually/)).

I've submitted the extension to the Chrome Web Store and will update this README once it's been approved.
